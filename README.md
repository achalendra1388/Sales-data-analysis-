# Sales-data-analysis-

This project focuses on sales analysis and prediction for a retail dataset, where the target
variable is Item_Outlet_Sales. It employs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends,
patterns, and relationships between product and store attributes. Missing values are handled
using imputation techniques, and categorical variables are transformed using encoding
methods like OrdinalEncoder and LabelEncoder.
Using advanced regression models, such as Random Forest and Linear Regression, the project
predicts sales while assessing model performance through metrics like Root Mean Square Error
(RMSE). The findings offer valuable insights into factors driving sales, aiding retailers in
optimizing operations, improving customer satisfaction, and maximizing revenue.
